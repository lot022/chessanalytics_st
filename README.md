# chessanalytics-st

Graphical representation of functions from chessanalytics designed for Streamlit apps.

# NOTE.

Not all functions from chessanalytics could be presented in graphical way. Functions returning single integer or two-element list do not have huge potential 
of graphical representation. That is why the two libraries may vary a little - chessanalytics_st does not have all functions from chessanalytics, but has some that chessanalytics does not have. This library strictly focuses on streamlit and uses 'st.' functions for plotting, representing data and so on. 

# Installation.

     $ pip install chessanalytics_st


# Initializing class.

      from chessanalytics_st import CAST
      cast = CAST('path/to/file/with/games', 'username')

looking slightly different. The chart itself looks like this:

# How does heatmap plots look?

This is a sample heatmap of king_square_captures() with default params (colorscale set to 'plasma', showscale set to True).

(chessnalytics/plots_png/plot1.png)


Here is the same funcion but without showscale and with colorscale set to 'plotly3'. Note that setting off showscale makes heatmap look more like a rect than square and less readable. 

![all_text](plots_png/plot2.png)

Here you can see how does the heatmap look without the title.

# TIPS AND TRICKS.

1. If you do not like how does the title look but setting it to 'None' makes the plot/heatmap look worse, set the title to " " (one space sign). 

2. If you do not like how particular funcion look but want to plot it using Streamlit, just call the function from chessanalytics library and plot it 
yourself. 

3. I have made a cheatsheet with (almost) all the functions and their possibilites. To see which type of plot in the same func is better, check it out here: will add soon :)

4. I have made a sample Streamlit app to show how can it possibly look. If you are looking for inspiration you can see it here: will add soon :)
